                <p>Organic farming avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators, and chemically treated livestock feed. Our products are made using natural materials, free from artificial chemicals. There is an increasing demand for organic products, especially by a new generation in urban areas. People are becoming increasingly aware of the harmful effects of chemically treated food. By offering our products on your shelves, you’re meeting this demand attracting new customers to your business.</p>
                <p>Our products are certified organic under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) by Agriculture & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the EU, and FSSAI. This company is running under the supervision of Ambuja Cement Foundation as a nodal agency and promoted by NABARD. All farmers have been certified from Uttarakhand State Organic Certification Agency (USOCA) Dehradun under NPOP.</p>
